# simultaneous-nmt
Simultaneous neural machine translation that uses prediction on the source side.
This code is a Theano implementation of EMNLP18 paper [Prediction Improves Simultaneous Neural Machine Translation](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1337). Our implementations are based on [dl4mt-simul-trans](https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4mt-simul-trans) repository developed by Gu et al.


# Dataset

- We have used WMT'16 corpora as our dataset for pretraining and training our model parameters.
- All datasets can be found in the directory " **/cs/natlang-expts/aalineja/dl4mt-simul-trans/data** " on SFU server.
