# simultaneous-nmt
Simultaneous neural machine translation that uses prediction on the source side.
This code is a Theano implementation of EMNLP18 paper [Prediction Improves Simultaneous Neural Machine Translation](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1337). Our implementations are based on [dl4mt-simul-trans](https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4mt-simul-trans) repository developed by Gu et al.


# Dataset

- We have used WMT'15 corpora as our dataset for pretraining and training our agent parameters.
- Newstest 2013 for validation and testset.
- The data should be tokenized and Byte Pair Encoded.
